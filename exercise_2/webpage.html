      <p>Web consists of billions of clients and server connected through wires and wireless networks. The web clients make requests to web server. The web server receives the request, finds the resources and return the response to the client. When a server answers a request, it usually sends some type of content to the client. The client uses web browser to send request to the server. The server often sends response to the browser with a set of instructions written in HTML(HyperText Markup Language). All browsers know how to display HTML page to the client.Web development, or web programming, is a general term for the processes and skills required to create websites and web applications. Examples of web apps include games, messenger applications, email, online stores, and more. In simpler terms, everything that you encounter in a web browser and all background processes have been created by a web developer. Depending on whether or not the content you create is visible or “invisible”, you will be classified as a front-end or back-end developer.Front-end development involves all of the things the user sees on the page when they interact with your site or web application.A front-end developer takes images, text, design, animations, and colors chosen by the web designer and implements them into the website. They ensure that everything is in place and that data coming from the back-end is being displayed correctly on the user’s web browser.They also determine if all client-side logic is working properly. Their primary tools include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each of these languages controls one of the three vital elements of a web page: content, design, and functionality.There are many more languages to learn, but these are the three core tools that a front-end developer must absolutely know.These days, front-end developers are also expected to know a few frameworks, such as Angular.js, React, Vue.js, and Bootstrap.A site builder, on the other hand, is an entry-level position within front-end development that involves taking a design and turning it into reality with the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.Site builders don’t deal with any of the back-end or server-side languages but focus more on converting artistic vision into computer code. Starting as a site builder requires minimal coding knowledge (compared to other positions) and is a great way to begin your career in web development.</p>

<h3>Structural Components:</h3>
As the name suggests, these components make the structure of the application. These components include the client or web browser, database server, and web app server which are directly responsible for functions deciding the user interactions within the application. In the majority of cases, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML are used to create these components. However, it all varies with the web app developer.
<h3>User Interface Components:</h3>
The other one is the user interface components that contribute to the visual interface of the app. However, unlike structural components, that do not interact with the architecture, but are limited to displaying the web page. These components include a dashboard, widget, settings, notifications, and many other visual elements that help in making the user experience better. In other words, these components are directly responsible for the UX or the web app

      <h2 id="Mod4">Overview of HTTP</h2>
            <center><img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview/fetching_a_page.png"></center>
      <p>
	The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. This is the foundation for data communication for the World Wide Web (i.e. internet) since 1990. HTTP is a generic and stateless protocol which can be used for other purposes as well using extensions of its request methods, error codes, and headers.

	Basically, HTTP is a TCP/IP based communication protocol, that is used to deliver data (HTML files, image files, query results, etc.) on the World Wide Web. The default port is TCP 80, but other ports can be used as well. It provides a standardized way for computers to communicate with each other. HTTP specification specifies how clients' request data will be constructed and sent to the server, and how the servers respond to these requests.
There are three basic features that make HTTP a simple but powerful protocol:

    HTTP is connectionless: The HTTP client, i.e., a browser initiates an HTTP request and after a request is made, the client waits for the response. The server processes the request and sends a response back after which client disconnect the connection. So client and server knows about each other during current request and response only. Further requests are made on new connection like client and server are new to each other.

    HTTP is media independent: It means, any type of data can be sent by HTTP as long as both the client and the server know how to handle the data content. It is required for the client as well as the server to specify the content type using appropriate MIME-type.

    HTTP is stateless: As mentioned above, HTTP is connectionless and it is a direct result of HTTP being a stateless protocol. The server and client are aware of each other only during a current request. Afterwards, both of them forget about each other. Due to this nature of the protocol, neither the client nor the browser can retain information between different requests across the web pages

 Web security refers to protecting networks and computer systems from damage to or the theft of software, hardware, or data. It includes protecting computer systems from misdirecting or disrupting the services they are designed to provide.

Web security is synonymous with cybersecurity and also covers website security, which involves protecting websites from attacks. It includes cloud security and web application security, which defend cloud services and web-based applications, respectively. Protection of a virtual private network (VPN) also falls under the web security umbrella.

Web security is crucial to the smooth operation of any business that uses computers. If a website is hacked or hackers are able to manipulate your systems or software, your website—and even your entire network—can be brought down, halting business operations.

To comply with internal policies, government-imposed criteria, or Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) standards, security professionals consider a variety of factors. Keeping abreast with OWASP standards helps security staff stay up to date with industry-standard web safety expectations.

In addition, encryption must be kept up to date, the latest threats in the Web Hacking Incident Database (WHID) monitored, and user authentications properly managed. When vulnerabilities emerge, security personnel must install the most recent patches to address them. To secure data, software development teams have to implement protocols that shield code from being stolen during or after writing it.Ensuring that your website or open web application is secure is critical. Even simple bugs in your code can result in private information being leaked, and bad people are out there trying to find ways to steal data. The web security-oriented articles listed here provide information that may help you secure your site and its code from attacks and data theft
